The Razorback shop makes $ 5 dollars off each jersey and $ 215 off each t-shirt. During the Arkansas and Texas tech game they sold 20 t-shirts and 64 jerseys. How much money did they make from selling the t-shirts? Equation: <equation> 215 * 20</equation> #<scratch>The Razorback shop makes $ 5 dollars off each jersey and $ 215 off each t-shirt. During the Arkansas and Texas tech game they sold 20 t-shirts and 64 jerseys. How much money did they make from selling the t-shirts?  Let's think step-by-step.  First, we need to find the total amount of money they made from selling the t-shirts. We know that they sold 20 t-shirts and each t-shirt costs $ 215, so the total amount of money they made from selling the t-shirts is 215 * 20 = $ 4300.  Now, we need to subtract the amount of money they made from selling the jerseys from the total amount of money they made from selling the t-shirts. We know that they sold 64 jerseys and each jersey costs $ 5, so the total amount of money they made from selling the jerseys is 5 * 64 = $ 320.  Therefore, the total amount of money they made from selling the t-shirts and jerseys is 4300 - 320 = $ 3980.   The final answer: 4300#4300

He then went to see the oranges being harvested. He found out that they harvest 74 sacks per day and discard 71 of them. How many sacks of oranges will they have after 51 days of harvest? Equation: <equation> 3 * 51</equation> #<scratch>First find the number of sacks of oranges that are not discarded by subtracting the number of sacks that are discarded from the number of sacks that are harvested. 74 - 71 = 3. Then multiply the number of sacks of oranges that are not discarded by the number of days of harvest to find the total number of sacks of oranges. 3 * 51 = 153. </scratch>#153

Equation: <equation> 87 * 95</equation> #<scratch>The Razorback t-shirt shop makes $ 87 dollars off each t-shirt sold. During the Arkansas game and the Texas tech game they sold a total of 95 t-shirts. If they sold 47 t-shirts during the Arkansas game, how much money did they make from selling the t-shirts?  Let's think step-by-step.  First, we need to figure out how many t-shirts they sold during the Texas tech game. We know that they sold a total of 95 t-shirts and they sold 47 t-shirts during the Arkansas game, so they sold 95 - 47 = 48 t-shirts during the Texas tech game.  Now, we need to multiply the number of t-shirts they sold by the price per t-shirt to find out how much money they made. We know that they sold 48 t-shirts and each t-shirt costs $87, so they made 48 * 87 = $4136 from selling the t-shirts.  Therefore, the final answer is 4136.</scratch>#4136

Equation: <equation> 6 * 26</equation> #<scratch>The machine made 6 shirts a minute for 12 minutes yesterday, so it made 6 * 12 = 72 shirts yesterday. The machine made 6 shirts a minute for 14 minutes today, so it made 6 * 14 = 84 shirts today. The machine made 72 + 84 = 156 shirts altogether. </scratch>#156

A mailman has to give 4 pieces of junk mail to each house in each of the 16 blocks. If there are 17 houses in each block How many pieces of junk mail should he give in total? Equation: <equation> ( ( 4.0 * 17.0 ) * 16.0 )</equation>#<scratch>A mailman has to give 4 pieces of junk mail to each house in each of the 16 blocks. If there are 17 houses in each block How many pieces of junk mail should he give in total?  Let's think step-by-step.  First, we need to find the total number of houses in all the blocks: 16 blocks * 17 houses / block = 272 houses.  Then, we need to multiply that number by the number of pieces of junk mail per house: 272 houses * 4 pieces / house = 1088 pieces of junk mail.  Therefore, the final answer is 1088.  Here is the Scratch code:  ``` let housesPerBlock = 17; let blocks = 16; let piecesPerHouse = 4;  let totalPieces = housesPerBlock * blocks * piecesPerHouse;  print(totalPieces); ```  </scratch>#1088
Lewis earns $ 28 every week during the 1091 weeks of harvest. He also earns $ 939 per week for working overtime. If he works overtime every week How much money does he earn during harvest season? Equation: <equation> 967 * 1091</equation> #<scratch>Lewis earns $ 28 every week during the 1091 weeks of harvest. He also earns $ 939 per week for working overtime. If he works overtime every week, he earns $ 28 + $ 939 = $ 967 per week. So, he earns $ 967 * 1091 = $ 1056173 during harvest season.</scratch>#1056173
