At the zoo, a cage had 3 snakes and 75 alligators. If 82 snakes and 19 alligators were hiding How many alligators were not hiding? Equation: <equation> 75-19</equation> #<scratch>Subtracting 19 from 75 at digit level;  75 > 19;  Borrow: 0; 75 - 19 = 56. move one place left; 0 becomes 0; Subtracting 0 from 0 at digit level;  0 >= 0;  Borrow: 0; 0 - 0 = 0. move one place left; 75 remains 75; final result: 56.</scratch>#56
Mary is baking a cake. The recipe calls for 7 cups of sugar and 10 cups of flour. She already put in 4 cups of sugar. How many more cups of sugar does she need to add? Equation: <equation> 7-4</equation> #<scratch>Subtracting 4 from 7 at digit level;  7 >= 4;  Borrow: 0; 7 - 4 = 3. move one place left; 7 remains 7; final result: 3.</scratch>#3
The grasshopper and the frog had a jumping contest. The grasshopper jumped 13 inches. The grasshopper jumped 2 inches farther than the grasshopper. How far did the frog jump? Equation: <equation> 13-02</equation> #<scratch>Subtracting 2 from 3 at digit level;  3 >= 2;  Borrow: 0; 3 - 2 = 1. move one place left; 1 remains 1; Subtracting 0 from 1 at digit level;  1 >= 0;  Borrow: 0; 1 - 0 = 1. move one place left; 3 remains 3; final result: 11.</scratch>#11
