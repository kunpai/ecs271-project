Current carry is 0; 939 multiplied by 1091 plus carry gives 1029199; new carry is 0; result is 1029199.  Adding 30648 and 1029199 at digit level. Current carry is 0; 30648 plus 1029199 plus carry gives 1059847; new carry is 0; result is 1059847. The overall result is 1059847</scratch>,1059847
Melissa scored 109 points in each game. She also got 82 bonus points in each game. How many points did she score in 79 games? Equation: <equation> ( ( 109.0 + 82.0 ) * 79.0 )</equation> ,<scratch> Multiplying 109 and 79 at digit level. Current carry is 0; 109 times 79 plus carry gives 8591; new carry is 0; result is 8591.  Multiplying 82 and 79 at digit level. Current carry is 0; 82 times 79 plus carry gives 6478; new carry is 0; result is 6478.  Adding 8591 and 6478 at digit level. Current carry is 0; 8591 plus 6478 plus carry gives 15069; new carry is 0; result is 15069. The overall result is 15069</scratch>,15069
After resting they decided to go for a swim. The depth of the water is 9 times Dean's height. If Ron is 15 feet tall and Dean is 6 feet shorter than Ron How deep was the water? Equation: <equation> ( ( 15.0 - 6.0 ) * 9.0 )</equation> ,<scratch> Subtracting 6 from 15 at digit level. Current carry is 0; 15 minus 6 plus carry gives 9; new carry is NaN; result is 9.  Multiplying 9 and 9 at digit level. Current carry is 0; 9 times 9 plus carry gives 81; new carry is NaN; result is 81. The overall result is 81</scratch>,81
Paige was helping her mom plant flowers and together they planted 55 seeds. They put 15 seeds in each flower bed and only 60 seeds grew into flowers in each flower bed. How many flowers did they grow? Equation: <equation> ( 60.0 * ( 55.0 / 15.0 ) )</equation> ,<scratch> Dividing 55 by 15 at digit level. Current carry is 0; 55 divided by 15 gives 3; new carry is 10; result is 3.  Multiplying 3 by 60 at digit level. Current carry is 0; 3 multiplied by 60 gives 180; new carry is 0; result is 180. The overall result is 180</scratch>,180
